# Railway-specific build configuration
# Railway uses Nixpacks by default, which auto-detects Python
# This overrides the start command to use gunicorn (which auto-binds to $PORT)

[start]
# Bind to Railway-provided $PORT and all interfaces so health checks can reach the app
cmd = "gunicorn run:app --workers 2 --threads 2 --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT}"
